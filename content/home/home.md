{{< about-section
    title="About me"
    content="Hey there ðŸ‘‹ Iâ€™m <b>Jacob</b> â€” a tech enthusiast turned SRE with a love for keeping systems running smoothly. I actually started out in cinematography, but somewhere along the way, the world of infrastructure and automation stole the spotlight. <br> These days, youâ€™ll find me diving into Kubernetes, tinkering with DevOps tools, and making sure things stay up and running (because downtime isnâ€™t fun for anyone). I geek out on reliability, scalability, and the challenge of making complex systems simple. <br>Outside of work, Iâ€™m always looking for ways to grow my skills and level up my career in the SRE path."
